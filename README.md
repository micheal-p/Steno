# 🕵️‍♂️ Steganography Detection App

This project detects steganography (hidden messages) in image files using basic LSB (Least Significant Bit) analysis. It also includes placeholders for AI-based detection and support for audio and video steganography detection in the future.

🚀 How to Run the Detection Script

Step 1: Open Terminal or PowerShell

Navigate to the project folder:

cd path/to/stego-detector

Step 2: Run the Detection

Example command:

python detector.py

Or, import it into another script and use like this:

from detector import detect_steganography

result = detect_steganography("sample_images/hidden_image.png")
print(result)
